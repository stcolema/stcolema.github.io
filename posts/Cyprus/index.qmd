## Summary

I attended the Bayesian Non-Parametrics Networking Event in Nicosia, Cyprus and then wandered around the interior of the island. An immense time.

Notes:

-   The BNP commmunity are very friendly depsite the intimdation factor of David Dunson, Aad van der Vaart and Judith Rousseau; I will attend as many of BNP events as possible in the future as is possible.
-   Cyprus is great and has more variety than I expect, but I'm very glad I wasn't there even two weeks later, too much sun for me.
-   Rome2Rio is a fantastic app and made the trip into the interior feasible.

## Background

I was delighted/massively intimidated to be offered a speaking slot at [the BNP Networking Event in Cyprus in April 2022](http://cyprusconferences.org/bnp2022/). I was delighted as Cyprus was meant to be great, but intimidated as my work wasn't really non-parametric or Bayesian and I knew from the agenda that Aad van der Vaart and Judith Rousseau would be there; two people who have provided immensely important and innovative contributions to Bayesian non-parametrics. David Dunson would also be going, but I figured David was likely to appreciate my work on pragmatic grounds, but stil, I was not without additional trepidation due to this factor - I'm a big fan of David's work, he's very smart and rejection would have been uncomfortable to say the least.

Regardless, I was going and decided to try and do something I'd wanted to do for awhile, a running holiday. I planned to get a bus from Nicosa into the interior and basically circumvent the Cypriot Mt. Olympus (not to be confused with the Grecian or Martian mountains of the same name). So even if I had a crippling rejection from all of the academics I most admired I would probably have a nice time of it. My old Vibrams were wearing thin, so I presented myself with a pair of the new [V-trail 2.0](https://www.vibrams.co.uk/products/v-trail-2-0-mens-black) as I expected to be off-piste for a large chunk of the running. I was a little anxious that I hadn't broken them in enough as I expected to be going serious distance a day wearing a backpack; I had only done about 40km before heading out.

I also made sure to check out speciality coffee bars in Nicosa using [the European Coffee Trip](https://europeancoffeetrip.com/city-guides/). I was determined to hit "A $\kappa\chi$offee project" at the least.

Thus, a holiday of Bayes, barefoot running and coffee was born.

## Nicosia, BNP and a fantastic coffee

I got into Nicosia quite late the day before the conference began; I hadn't appreciated how far away Cyprus is, but the shuttle from Larnaca airport into Nicosia was cheap (I think 8 euro?) and pretty easy. I eventually got into my flat for the week which was down by Konstantinou & Elenis cemetary. I wanted to be near enough to both a park and the University where the conference was being hosted, and this fit the bill, as well as giving me some space where I could unwind, work and cook for myself.

I displayed immense wisdom on the first morning. I didn't go out for a run and instead made an approximation of shakshouka. The day was already set-up to be intensely hot. Everyday in Nicosia would hover around the $30^o$C mark for a few hours around midday; thankfully the theatre the conference talks were in was plenty cool.

I think there was about 70 people in attendance in total, and it took awhile for everyone to trickle in. I was pretty excited for the tutorials, David would be opening and I had enjoyed [previous](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swC2i2h7R5Y) [talks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYp2GGo2KKU) [of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ewUbZe7r4HA) [his](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-_0X1AsrNk) (including [one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scKQy9LdKhk) which I technically hosted), and his tutorial "Some musings on Bayesian non-parametrics" sounded open enough to accessible and interesting. I wasn't familiar with Yanxun Xu, but her work was very applied so I expected to enjoy it. I was not sure how much of Aad's tutorial I'd follow with a lack of technical background, but I was looking forward to the challenge as this is the man who wrote [the book](https://www-cambridge-org.ezp.lib.cam.ac.uk/gb/academic/subjects/statistics-probability/statistical-theory-and-methods/fundamentals-nonparametric-bayesian-inference?format=HB&isbn=9780521878265) on BNP.

Most of the talks were over my head throughout the conference, so I'm not going to even attempt discuss all of the talks as I could not do them justice. Instead I'll mention a few I particularly resonated with:

-   Lasse Vuursteen, "A Bayesian approach to multiview learning".
-   [Judith Rousseau](https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~rousseau/), "[Bayesian nonparametric estimation of a density living near an unknown manifold](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.15717)".
-   Chris Holmes, "Why don't Bayesians bootstrap?" (I think this is the appropriate [paper](https://academic-oup-com.ezp.lib.cam.ac.uk/biomet/article/106/2/465/5385582)).
-   [Thibault Randrianarisoa](https://thibaultrandrianarisoa.netlify.app/), "[Smoothing and adaptation of shifted PÃ³lya Tree ensembles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.12299)".
-   Deborah Sulem, "[Bayesian nonparametric estimation of nonlinear Hawkes processes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.17164)".
-   [Jordan Bryan](https://j-g-b.github.io/), "[The multirank likelihood and cyclically monotone Monte Carlo: a semiparametric approach to CCA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.07465)".
-   Minh-Lien Jeanne Nguyen, "Bernstein-von Mises for semiparametric mixture".
-   [Mariia Vladimirova](https://sites.google.com/site/mrvladimirova), "[Bayesian Neural Networks at Finite and Infinite Widths](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v157/vladimirova21a.html)".
-   Dennis Nieman, "[Contraction rates and uncertainty quantification for variational Bayes](https://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume23/21-1128/21-1128.pdf)".

I unfortunately had to miss a set of talks to host an [online talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rUKuzhrHJE8) from [Trevor Campbell](https://trevorcampbell.me/) about his and his group's work on Bayesian coresets. This loss was mitigated by how great a talk Trevor gave. The work itself is very interesting (hence why I had been attempting to wrangle an invite to Trevor to speak for awhile), but Trevor has also clearly thought a lot about how to convey information and how to present his work, so I really enjoyed it.

My own talk went down well, with both David and Sara Wade being particularly positive. It was really nice to have the opportunity to discuss the work a little with them both.
