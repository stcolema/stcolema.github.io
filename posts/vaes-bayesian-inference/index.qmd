description: "From Bayes' rule to VAEs: understanding variational inference for deep generative models"
---

This post explores how Variational Autoencoders connect classical Bayesian inference to modern deep learning. Starting from Bayes' rule and moving through the Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO) derivation, I cover the reparameterization trick, amortized inference, and practical implementation considerations.

## Formats

-   [**Read as article**](article.html) - Full explanation with detailed derivations
-   [**View slides**](slides.html) - Presentation format from my lab meeting

The article version is recommended for careful study with all mathematical details. The slides provide a visual overview suitable for quick reference.
