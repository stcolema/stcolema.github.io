An immense time.\n\nNotes:\n\n-   The BNP commmunity are very friendly depsite the intimdation factor of David Dunson, Aad van der Vaart and Judith Rousseau; I will attend as many of BNP events as possible in the future as is possible.\n-   Cyprus is great and has more variety than I expect, but I'm very glad I wasn't there even two weeks later, too much sun for me.\n-   Rome2Rio is a fantastic app and made the trip into the interior feasible.\n\n## Background\n\nI was delighted/massively intimidated to be offered a speaking slot at [the BNP Networking Event in Cyprus in April 2022](http://cyprusconferences.org/bnp2022/). I was delighted as Cyprus was meant to be great, but intimidated as my work wasn't really non-parametric or Bayesian and I knew from the agenda that Aad van der Vaart and Judith Rousseau would be there; two people who have provided immensely important and innovative contributions to Bayesian non-parametrics. David Dunson would also be going, but I figured David was likely to appreciate my work on pragmatic grounds, but stil, I was not without additional trepidation due to this factor - I'm a big fan of David's work, he's very smart and rejection would have been uncomfortable to say the least.\n\nRegardless, I was going and decided to try and do something I'd wanted to do for awhile, a running holiday. I planned to get a bus from Nicosa into the interior and basically circumvent the Cypriot Mt. Olympus (not to be confused with the Grecian or Martian mountains of the same name). So even if I had a crippling rejection from all of the academics I most admired I would probably have a nice time of it. My old Vibrams were wearing thin, so I presented myself with a pair of the new [V-trail 2.0](https://www.vibrams.co.uk/products/v-trail-2-0-mens-black) as I expected to be off-piste for a large chunk of the running. I was a little anxious that I hadn't broken them in enough as I expected to be going serious distance a day wearing a backpack; I had only done about 40km before heading out.\n\nI also made sure to check out speciality coffee bars in Nicosa using [the European Coffee Trip](https://europeancoffeetrip.com/city-guides/). I was determined to hit \"A $\\kappa\\chi$offee project\" at the least.\n\nThus, a holiday of Bayes, barefoot running and coffee was born.\n\n## Nicosia, BNP and a fantastic coffee\n\nI got into Nicosia quite late the day before the conference began; I hadn't appreciated how far away Cyprus is, but the shuttle from Larnaca airport into Nicosia was cheap (I think 8 euro?) and pretty easy. I eventually got into my flat for the week which was down by Konstantinou & Elenis cemetary. I wanted to be near enough to both a park and the University where the conference was being hosted, and this fit the bill, as well as giving me some space where I could unwind, work and cook for myself.\n\nI displayed immense wisdom on the first morning. I didn't go out for a run and instead made an approximation of shakshouka. The day was already set-up to be intensely hot. Everyday in Nicosia would hover around the $30^o$C mark for a few hours around midday; thankfully the theatre the conference talks were in was plenty cool.\n\nI think there was about 70 people in attendance in total, and it took awhile for everyone to trickle in. I was pretty excited for the tutorials, David would be opening and I had enjoyed [previous](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swC2i2h7R5Y) [talks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYp2GGo2KKU) [of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ewUbZe7r4HA) [his](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-_0X1AsrNk) (including [one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scKQy9LdKhk) which I technically hosted), and his tutorial \"Some musings on Bayesian non-parametrics\" sounded open enough to accessible and interesting. I wasn't familiar with Yanxun Xu, but her work was very applied so I expected to enjoy it. I was not sure how much of Aad's tutorial I'd follow with a lack of technical background, but I was looking forward to the challenge as this is the man who wrote [the book](https://www-cambridge-org.ezp.lib.cam.ac.uk/gb/academic/subjects/statistics-probability/statistical-theory-and-methods/fundamentals-nonparametric-bayesian-inference?format=HB&isbn=9780521878265) on BNP.\n\nMost of the talks were over my head throughout the conference, so I'm not going to even attempt discuss all of the talks as I could not do them justice. Instead I'll mention a few I particularly resonated with:\n\n-   Lasse Vuursteen, \"A Bayesian approach to multiview learning\".\n-   [Judith Rousseau](https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~rousseau/), \"[Bayesian nonparametric estimation of a density living near an unknown manifold](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.15717)\".\n-   Chris Holmes, \"Why don't Bayesians bootstrap?\" (I think this is the appropriate [paper](https://academic-oup-com.ezp.lib.cam.ac.uk/biomet/article/106/2/465/5385582)).\n-   [Thibault Randrianarisoa](https://thibaultrandrianarisoa.netlify.app/), \"[Smoothing and adaptation of shifted PÃ³lya Tree ensembles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.12299)\".\n-   Deborah Sulem, \"[Bayesian nonparametric estimation of nonlinear Hawkes processes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.17164)\".\n-   [Jordan Bryan](https://j-g-b.github.io/), \"[The multirank likelihood and cyclically monotone Monte Carlo: a semiparametric approach to CCA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.07465)\".\n-   Minh-Lien Jeanne Nguyen, \"Bernstein-von Mises for semiparametric mixture\".\n-   [Mariia Vladimirova](https://sites.google.com/site/mrvladimirova), \"[Bayesian Neural Networks at Finite and Infinite Widths](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v157/vladimirova21a.html)\".\n-   Dennis Nieman, \"[Contraction rates and uncertainty quantification for variational Bayes](https://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume23/21-1128/21-1128.pdf)\".\n\nI unfortunately had to miss a set of talks to host an [online talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rUKuzhrHJE8) from [Trevor Campbell](https://trevorcampbell.me/) about his and his group's work on Bayesian coresets. This loss was mitigated by how great a talk Trevor gave. The work itself is very interesting (hence why I had been attempting to wrangle an invite to Trevor to speak for awhile), but Trevor has also clearly thought a lot about how to convey information and how to present his work, so I really enjoyed it.\n\nMy own talk went down well, with both David and Sara Wade being particularly positive. It was really nice to have the opportunity to discuss the work a little with them both.\n\nI found the conference very wearing though; I'm not fluent in BNP, the travel to be there and as an autistic person that level of exposure to people was just a lot. As a reward I gave myself leave to come in late on the Friday, and hit up \"A $\\kappa\\chi$offee project\". I had a beautiful iced filter coffee, the aromatics came through really clearly.\n\n![](pictures/coffee.jpg)\n\n## Running\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(leaflet)\nleaflet() %>%\n  addTiles() %>%\n  addMarkers(\n    lng=32.863873641417335, \n    lat=34.936726200280894, \n    label=\"Mt.

I bussed down to Kyperounta, did the Madari Circular trail, slept, walked/ran to Pedoulas via Artemis Lake (a let down). Pedoulas was pleasant, but this entire day was spent going uphill essentially so I was destroyed. Pedoulas to Pano Platres, Millomeris Waterfall, Caledonian Waterfall, etc. \n\n![The friendly locals of Pedoulas.](./pictures/dog.jpg)\n\n::: {#fig-interior layout-ncol=\"2\"}\n![](./pictures/Trails/IMG_20220501_112851.jpg){#fig-trail-1}\n\n![](./pictures/Trails/IMG_20220501_113239.jpg){#fig-trail-2}\n\n![](./pictures/Trails/IMG_20220501_114536.jpg){#fig-trail-3}\n\n![](./pictures/Trails/IMG_20220503_094038.jpg){#fig-trail-4}\n\n![](./pictures/Trails/IMG_20220503_095946.jpg){#fig-trail-5}\n\n![](./pictures/Trails/IMG_20220503_103856.jpg){#fig-trail-6}\n\n![](./pictures/Trails/IMG_20220503_112028.jpg){#fig-trail-7}\n\n![](./pictures/Trails/IMG_20220503_120535.jpg){#fig-trail-8}\n\n![](./pictures/Trails/IMG_20220504_090211.jpg){#fig-trail-9}\n\n![](./pictures/Trails/IMG_20220504_094411.jpg){#fig-trail-10}\n\n![](./pictures/Trails/IMG_20220504_111813.jpg){#fig-trail-12}\n\n![](./pictures/Trails/IMG_20220504_120055.jpg){#fig-trail-14}\n\n![](./pictures/Trails/IMG_20220504_121401.jpg){#fig-trail-15}\n\n![](./pictures/Trails/IMG_20220504_123721.jpg){#fig-trail-16}\n\n![](./pictures/Trails/IMG_20220504_125317.jpg){#fig-trail-17}\n\n![](./pictures/Trails/IMG_20220504_150925.jpg){#fig-trail-19}\n\n![](./pictures/Trails/IMG_20220504_151236.jpg){#fig-trail-20}\n\n![](./pictures/Trails/IMG_20220504_153431.jpg){#fig-trail-21}\n\n![](./pictures/Trails/IMG_20220504_125330.jpg){#fig-trail-18}\n\n![](./pictures/Trails/IMG_20220504_154005.jpg){#fig-trail-22}\n\n![](./pictures/Trails/IMG_20220504_155054.jpg){#fig-trail-23}\n\n![](./pictures/Trails/IMG_20220504_160950.jpg){#fig-trail-24}\n\n![](./pictures/Trails/IMG_20220504_171843.jpg){#fig-trail-25}\n\n![](./pictures/Trails/vibrams_1.jpg){#fig-trail-27}\n\nTrails in the interior\n:::\n\n## Cats\n\nCyprus aslo has many stray cats.
